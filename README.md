# Web Dev Tutorial

Things that I'm looking to teach. Assuming that they have zero previous programming knowledge.

So web dev is divided into 3 parts
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

Today we're going to touch on all of these 3 things briefly as you can't really do anything without the other. To make this tutorial more focused on marketing and helpful for you guys, I'm looking to do something very simple.

## Objectives:

- Make a static single web page with tons of media and how to manipulate that media/image to your advantage.
- Some Bootstrap tutorial to improve your CSS as that is something you'll come across quite often.
- Touch briefly on Javascript (it's a big learning curve if you haven't done programming before)
- I'm not looking to host the website in anyway, im gonna serve up raw html files to the browser and look at all the components mainly. After today if you guys feel you like the stuff, we can go in deep in the upcoming weeks.

# Steps

## One

create a html file and try to show it on localhost. html is divided into 3/4 parts depending on how you want to do it. here I'll have the html, css, js file separate because it gives more clarity on what is what.

html file on its own is divided into 2 parts. <head> <body>
first we try to serve up something in our webpage.
